# Playlist Matcher Application

The application aims to predict the compatibility of a given playlist with the user. By logging into the application using a Spotify account and providing the URL of a playlist, the user receives a percentage of how well the playlist matches their preferences, along with the songs that best fit. However, it's important to note that this is a demonstrative application for illustrative purposes only.

Recommendations are generated by retrieving songs from the user's library, their own public playlists, and liked tracks, marked as suitable for the user. Additionally, to create the recommendation model, songs from the Kaggle database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bricevergnou/spotify-recommendation) are included as negative examples. The model is trained at the time of login.
